# DropletSimuation

## Introduction
This project is aimed to simulate mechanical and osmotic interactions between droplets. It is implemented in C, C++, and CUDA. A graphical user interface (GUI) is developed using OpenGL to enable real-time monitoring of the simulation. The physical simulation and rendering processes are executed in separate threads to ensure that one does not delay the other when either becomes computationally intensive.
